Compilation of scripts used during my Master's thesis.

Includes a pipeline to create a clean intron reference with gap-filtering and deduplication of regions, among other quality-control checks. It is best to run the module on an HPC, but could be run on a high-end laptop.

Also available, a script for targeted coverage computing using *deepTools* (intended for its used together with the intron panel) and Rscript showing how to filter data and compute RNA polymerase II elongation speed out of coverage signal.
